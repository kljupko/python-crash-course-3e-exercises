The sections on Bootstrap and Platform.sh are not informative enough to teach working with UI or remote servers in general.
Instead, they instruct the reader to follow along, while superficially explaining the code.
This does not instill any broadly applicable knowledge. It simply shows the reader how to use Bootstrap and Platform.sh in these particular intsances.

Aborting chapter.
Will take separate courses on UI and server management when needed.

Django project considered complete.
